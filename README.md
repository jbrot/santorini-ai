# Santorini AI

This program aims to provide a terminal interface for the board game [Santorini](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/194655/santorini), along with a competent computer opponent.

My goals for this project are:
1. to refine my understanding of implementing a game AI from what I learned with [jstris-ai](https://github.com/jbrot/jstris-ai)
2. to learn Rust
